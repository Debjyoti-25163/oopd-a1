# oopd-a1
Assignment-1

Q1: As instructed in Question 1, I created a repository on my GitHub account and added a README.md file inside it. After setting it up, I cloned the repository into my local machine to work on the given tasks.

Q2: In Question 2, as per the instructions, I wrote a C++ program named debjyoti25163.cpp without using any standard library files. This program was designed to return only zero, without taking any input or producing any output. After that, I created a shell script file named debjyoti25163.sh, which contains the necessary commands to compile and execute the C++ file. Then I pushed them into my GitHub repository named oopd-a1 using Git commands.

Q3: In Question 3, I was required to write a C++ program that takes user input in the form of a name and an age. After collecting the data, the program asks the user to confirm whether the entered information is correct. If the confirmation is yes, the program accepts the data and ends the session. If the confirmation is no, the program displays Not accepted and then terminates.To execute this program, I created a shell script that runs the compiled code automatically. One of the key constraints was that I was not allowed to use the standard C++ library files. Instead, I had to work with the provided library files. Specifically, basicIO.cpp contained the definitions of functions needed to handle both integer and string input/output, while basicIO.h included the necessary header information for the program. Additionally, a file named syscall.s was provided, which implements the system calls used by the program. These system calls act as the interface between my C++ code and the Linux kernel, enabling essential operations such as input/output handling, process management, and communication with the underlying operating system. After successfully writing, compiling, and running the program, I verified its working as per the requirements. Finally, I pushed all the related files into my GitHub repository .
